I recently completed my PhD at UC Berkeley in the <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Research (BAIR) Lab</a> and am now at OpenAI.
In my research, I explored machine learning for robotics, advised by <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>.
I also did undergrad at Berkeley, working with <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a> and <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a> on similar topics.

I am generally interested in how to develop intelligent behavior through interaction, especially through offline reinforcement learning and self-supervised reinforcement learning.
