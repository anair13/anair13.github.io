I'm a fifth year graduate student at UC Berkeley in the <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Research (BAIR) Lab</a>. In my research, I explore machine learning for robotics, advised by <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>. I am interested in how to develop intelligent behavior through interaction, specifically through offline reinforcement learning and self-supervised reinforcement learning.

I also did my undergrad at Berkeley, working on similar topics with <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a> and <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>.

If you want to chat, shoot me an email at anair17<span class="domain">berkeley.edu</span>. Some of my projects are listed below.
