Over winter break, I started learning about computer vision algorithms and working on some intro vision projects. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449316549/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449316549&linkCode=as2&tag=ashvinme-20&linkId=2O2Z3UEH7B4KXBYU">This book</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=ashvinme-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449316549" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> has been really great for learning about it. It's really clear and introduces both the theory and practice of computer vision.
