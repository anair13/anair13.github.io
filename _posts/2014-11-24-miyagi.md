A web-app built on my own time at the request of some Berkeley MBA students for the Launch startup competition.

I got to play with the Google Maps API as well as perfect my quick website deployment strategy: launch a Rails app with AngularJS, deploy it on DigitalOcean and use WebBrick to serve it on port 80. Use rails scaffolding and the Beautiful-Scaffold library for making acceptable-looking, functional pages.
